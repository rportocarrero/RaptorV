# RaptorV RISC-V Processor Core

Welcome to my RISC-V Processor project! This repository contains all the source code and scripts necessary to build and test a custom RISC-V processor.

## Directory Structure

- `/src` - This directory contains the Verilog source code for the RISC-V processor.
- `/test` - Contains test benches and simulation scripts.
- `/scripts` - Contains scripts for compilation, simulation, synthesis, and more.
- `/software` - Contains C source code examples and programs to run on the processor.
- `/docs` - Contains additional documentation and design specifications.

## How to Build

1. Navigate to the scripts directory: `cd scripts`
2. Run the build script: `./build.sh`

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the test directory: `cd test`
2. Run the test script: `./run_tests.sh`
